# RoboNest

RoboNest is a beginner-friendly robotics learning website. It helps makers explore robot projects, understand the parts and wiring involved, and find guidance for building and troubleshooting.

## Features

- Browse robotics projects and filter them by category, skill level, or microcontroller.
- Open project guides with build steps, parts lists, wiring and pinout references, and 3D model assets where available.
- Search a catalog of robotics components and export the catalog as CSV.
- Compare project parts and sample pricing and availability from electronics stores.
- Use the robotics assistant page for troubleshooting guides and an interactive line-follower pin simulator.
